# Dump available with code
## code library
- u will probably only need the things in /ninjasaga
- pet, npc, xp, gold, etc

## client library
- mayb u only need the key there
- who knows

## data library
- just for reference
- to make ur hack more good looking
- example: "Boss dropped item91"
- u could refer data library and change the text of item91 to something meaningfull

# Inside alan_test_xb42dfh, code not available, swf only
 - all of this shit u can dump urself(heh) 'cuz its not protected with obfuscation or anything lulz
